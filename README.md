# RED-BUS-SCRAPING 

I am thrilled to share my latest project focused on enhancing data collection, analysis, and visualization in the transportation industry! Here's a quick overview:

Objective: Automate the process of scraping bus route data from Redbus and provide dynamic filtering capabilities.

What I Did:

Automated Web Scraping: Utilized Selenium to extract detailed bus route information from Redbus, including departure times,arival timing, bus types, prices,star rating, and more.

SQL Database Storage: Efficiently stored the scraped data in a structured SQL database for reliable data management.

Interactive Streamlit App: Developed a user-friendly web application with Streamlit, offering dynamic filtering options to help users find the best bus routes.

* Use Case: This tool is beneficial for transportation service providers and passengers who need accurate and up-to-date bus route information.

Built with: Python, Selenium, SQL, Streamlit
