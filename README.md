# RED-BUS-SCRAPING 

The *'Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application'* project is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the collection, management, and visualization of bus travel data for the transportation industry. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. *Data Extraction with Selenium*:
   The project begins by automating the extraction of detailed bus travel information from the Redbus website using *Selenium*, a powerful tool for web automation. Selenium is programmed to simulate user interactions such as entering search criteria, clicking buttons, and navigating through web pages. It then collects essential data such as bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. This automation significantly reduces the manual effort required to gather large volumes of data, ensuring that the information is up-to-date and accurate.

2. *Data Management with MySQL*:
   Once the data is collected, it is transformed into a structured format using *pandas* DataFrames. This data is then stored in a *MySQL* database, where a new database and corresponding tables are created to organize the information effectively. The use of MySQL allows for efficient data management, making it easy to query, update, and maintain the data. This step is crucial for ensuring that the large datasets collected are well-organized and can be accessed quickly for analysis.

3. *Interactive Visualization with Streamlit*:
   To make the data accessible and useful to end-users, the project utilizes *Streamlit* to develop an interactive web application. This application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for specific bus routes, view available buses, and access detailed information such as departure times and prices. The dynamic filtering capability of Streamlit enables users to easily refine their search results based on various criteria, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

4. *Technology Stack*:
   - *Python 3.9*: The core programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
   - *Selenium*: For automating the data extraction process from the Redbus website.
   - *MySQL 8.0*: For storing and managing the collected bus travel data.
   - *Streamlit*: For creating the interactive web application that allows users to filter and visualize the data.

5. *Application Features*:
   - *Data Retrieval*: Automates the process of collecting real-time bus travel data from Redbus.
   - *Data Storage*: Organizes the collected data into a MySQL database for efficient management.
   - *Interactive Filtering*: Provides an intuitive Streamlit interface for users to filter and explore the data.

This project not only automates the labor-intensive process of data collection but also provides a powerful tool for transportation companies to make data-driven decisions, ultimately improving operational efficiency and strategic planning.
